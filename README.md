# The Sorting Hat  [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/432bd460-28ef-4cfe-b1ed-b368dda1b7a2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/acp-sorting-hat/deploys)

True to Harry Potter lore... The Sorting Hat will place each first year student into either Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw. All one needs to do to start the sorting process is to click 'Begin'. From there, the sorting hat does most of the work. Once a student is placed into a house, they can be expelled. This, of course, will lead to said student taking up arms against the wizarding world as a part of Voldemort's army.

## About the User
- The ideal user for this app is a Harry Potter fan who is looking for some quick entertainment.

## Features
- When the form is submitted, the new student is added to an array of student objects that are then pushed to the DOM and displayed as cards in the First Years section.
- The student object at this point has been assigned a house property with a random house value.
- The cards are ordered by which house they have been assigned. Gryffindor is first, followed by Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and finally Ravenclaw.
- Each card displays the color of the house that student has been assigned.
- Each card has an 'Expel' button capable of sending that student object to a new array which gets rendered to the DOM and displayed in the Voldy's Army section.
- The app is designed to be used with any device and is responsive.
